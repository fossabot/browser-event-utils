### Usage

These utilities are designed to "wrap" around your regular event handlers (ie: they return your event handler with some kind of super power). They can be used with vanilla Javascript, or with pretty much any framework which deals with DOM events. 

Note that when using with a framework that has its own event system (such as [React's SyntheticEvent system](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html)), there may be slight inconsistencies.

There are CodeSandbox examples made with React for all of the utilities [over here](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/sandboxes/browser-event-utils), so that you can test them out for yourself.
